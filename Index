      <p>
        Our KLAW team understands the delicate nature of e-waste and the importance of properly collecting, packing, and transporting it. A core mission of KLAW is to repurpose as many collected electronics as possible and keep dangerous metals out of landfills. If an item cannot be repurposed, we move to Plan B – Recycling.

    <button class="accordion">Why can't I put out electronics on in the trash? </button>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <p>Did you know that electronic waste (e-waste) has been classified as a hazardous material?</p>
      <p>Electronic items contain hazardous materials such as mercury, lead and silicon. For example, in order to protect consumers from radiation dangers, the glass in CRT monitors and TVs contain lead.  Approximately 20% of the weight in each CRT is lead – which equates to 4 to 8 pounds per unit.
        While these items are perfectly safe for everyday use, they become dangerous when smashed open (like on a garbage truck) or exposed to elements (like in a landfill). For these reasons, the proper computer recycling and disposal of e-waste has become a paramount concern for the general public.</p>

    <button class="accordion">Why repurpose and recycle electronics?</button>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <p>Electronics represent 70% of toxic waste in America. When broken and outdated hardware is sent to a landfill, it leeches dangerous chemicals into the air, water and soil. These pollutants include lead, cadmium and PCBs. Not only does repurposing and recycling reduce toxic waste, it also saves copper, gold, tungsten and other resources so that more do not need to be mined to make new device</p>
